<h3>To look at some python functions, Let's do something fun. In the beginning of the semester my professor, Dr. Woodward, talked about the Monty Hall problem. This is a fairly popular dilemma. If you are completely unfamiliar with the problem Google will probably give a better explanation, but if you just need a refresher I'll do a quick synopsis.</h3>

<h3>Let's think about this mathemathically. When three doors are closed and you choose one door (Let's say door #1), there's a 1/3 chance that you chose the correct door and a 2/3 chance that you did not. In this instance it seems like an equal probability of every door containing the prize. Once the host opens door 3, the probability that you chose the correct door is still 1/3. This probability does not change when the third door is opened because your inital choice was made when the all three doors were closed. This means there is still a 2/3 chance that the prize is not in door #1 but in door #2. Therefore, we would expect about a 2/3 probability of winning by switching your choice.</h3>

<h3>Let's actually prove that you should switch doors by replicating the three door experiment in python then calculating our chances of winning. Below is the code I've created. The code will be split into &quot;chunks&quot; and each respective description explaining the code will be written at the end.</h3>
<p>First, Let's define a function that will generate a random number from 1 to n.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>from __future__ import division 
import random

#defining random roll
def roll(n):
    return random.randint(1,n)</code></pre>
<p>Now Let's create a function where the computer will automate a random door number with the prize and a random door number that will represent our guess. Then, we will assign a door that will be viewed (the door that will be opened after a guess is made). A series of if statements is used to ensure that the door viewed will not be one that is guessed or one that contains the prize. In this simulation the guess door is switched every time after a door a &quot;viewed&quot;. Using a series of if statements, the new guess is now the door that was not the original guess or the viewed door. Lastly, if the new guess door is the same as the prize door, we consider it a win. If it is not, the function should return a lose.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#simulate guess, view, prize, and new guess
def runOneTrial():
    prize = roll(3)
    guess = roll(3)

    view = 1
    if prize !=2 and guess !=2:
        view = 2
    elif prize !=3 and guess !=3:
        view = 3

    newguess = 1
    if view != 2 and guess != 2:
        newguess = 2
    elif view != 3 and guess != 3:
        newguess = 3
    
    if newguess == prize:
        return &quot;win&quot;
    else:
        return &quot;lose&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Let's put it all together! We're going to start off with 0 wins, obviously. We're going to call the function we've created above on every trial. We're going to keep track of how many times we've won and loss the game. In the end, the probabilities of wins and losses are calculated depending on those numbers and the number of trials we run.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#put it all together and calculate wins
def montyhall(trials):
    wins = 0

    for i in range(0, trials):
        result = runOneTrial()
        if result == &quot;win&quot;:
            wins += 1
              
    prob = wins / trials
    loseprob = 1 - prob
    print(&quot;Probability of winning if you switch =&quot;,format(prob, &quot;.2f&quot;))
    print(&quot;Probability of winning if you do not switch =&quot;,format(loseprob, &quot;.2f&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Time to test it out! Let's say we do this experiment a thousand times.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>montyhall(1000)

#output
## Probability of winning if you switch = 0.66
## Probability of winning if you do not switch = 0.34</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the probability of winning if you switch doors is about 2/3 ! Do you believe me now?</p>

<div id="lets-talk-about-reticulate" class="section level1">
<h1>Lets talk about Reticulate</h1>
<p>I was more comfortable with python when coding for the simulation. However, there are some things that I am more comfortable with in R. What should I do? Luckily, something called reticulate will allow me to use both python and R with my data! Let's try it out.</p>
<p>Let's use both R and python to put an unbiased message string together.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
string &lt;- &quot;julia hwang is really...&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can add the strings together and then print out our well known fact.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>string2 = &quot;cool and awesome and amazing&quot;
print(r.string + string2)
## julia hwang is really...cool and awesome and amazing</code></pre>
<p>Cool right !</p>
<p>Let's try something else. I'll create a function using R to convert inches to centimeters.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>howtall &lt;- function(inches){
  cm &lt;- inches*2.52
  print(cm)
}</code></pre>
<p>We can call our R function in python. Since I'm 62 inches tall let's see how many centimeters that is.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>r.howtall(62)
## 156.24</code></pre>
<p>BAM I am a whole 156.24 cm tall. Should I just start referring to my height in centimeters to make myself sound taller?</p>
<p>Anyway, hope this was fun to read!</p>
